Field,Offset,Size,Struct,Explanation
LOO,0,3,3s,"Spells out ""LOO"", identifies a LOOP packet"
Bar Trend,3,1,B,"Signed byte that indicates the current 3-hour barometer trend. It 
is one of these values: 
-60 = Falling Rapidly  = 196 (as an unsigned byte) 
-20 = Falling Slowly   = 236 (as an unsigned byte) 
  0 = Steady 
 20 = Rising Slowly 
 60 = Rising Rapidly 
 80 = A SCII ""P"" = Rev A  firmware, no trend info is available 
A ny other value means that the V antage does not have the 3 
hours of bar data needed to determine the bar trend."
